## About Me  
I'm a Final-Year B.Tech student specializing in **Data Science & AI**. I love solving complex problems, exploring data, and building intelligent end-to-end ML pipelines. Experimenting with the newest advancements in **AI, MLOps, and Cloud Data Engineering** is what excites me. 

### What Iâ€™m Exploring:

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently diving deeper into **MLOps, CI/CD for ML models, Deep Learning architectures, and scalable cloud data pipelines** using AWS and Spark.  

ðŸŽ¯ 2025 Goals: Build innovative AI/ML projects, master **ETL workflows**, and contribute to open-source projects in AI and Data.  

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about **ML/AI, NLP, Speech Emotion Recognition, Cloud ETL Pipelines, Docker, Airflow, and Data Engineering workflows**.  

ðŸ”® Hobbies: I like to read books(my favorite novel is *Tuesdays with Morrie*), watch sitcoms or play Sudoku in my leisure time.
